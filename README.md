# Crafting Interpreters: In Go and Rust

Those are my interpreters for `lox`, the language used as an example in the fantastic book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## glox: The Go interpreter [work in progress]

> In the book this corresponds to `jlox`, a Java interpreter

In `glox` folder you can run:
- `make` to build the binary of the interpreter which will be named `glox`
- `make install` to install the interpreter globally

## rlox: The Rust interpreter [TODO]
